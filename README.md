## Building for Production

To create a production build:

- Windows: `mvnw clean package -Pproduction`
- Mac & Linux: `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction`

This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources, ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

To run the production build:
```bash
java -jar target/voice-crud-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
